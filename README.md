Based on Doraros's [FF2CFGGenerator](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=242497), this is a new Open-source Application to create and edit FreakFortress 2 Bosses. This editor was made from zero with a new user-friendly interface and new features.

### Prerequisites

You need .NET Framework 4.7.2 to run this editor. Also, this is available only on Windows 7 or greater. This editor may or may not work on Linux with Wine or similars.

### Installing

1) Download the last Zip depending of your system (x86 or x64) from Release.
2) Run FF2BossEditor.exe and there you go.
Optional: Go to Settings>Download Weapon Database to download the lastest Weapon Databse (The zip should contain its own DataBase).
